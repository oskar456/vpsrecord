Digital PDC/VPS analyzer/recorder
=================================

This is a simple DVB TS recorder with VPS Programme Delivery Control [ETSI EN
300 231][1] support. It requires TV channel to broadcast VPS data on line 16 of
Vertical Blanking Interval or PDC descriptors in Teletext packet 8/30/2. It
automatically starts recording when the programme really starts and stop
recording after programme finish.

This tool works as a filter, copying MPEG2-TS from standard input to standard
output when the programme should be recorded and discarding input otherwise.
After the end of the programme, the tool exits.
